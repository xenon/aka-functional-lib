# aka-functional-lib
A library with some functional helpers not found in Typescript.

`npm install aka-functional-lib`

## Optional
Includes an Optional (Some or None) type.

## Immutable
Includes an Immutable type for Typescript as well as runtime immutability
by means of recursively freezing an Object.

## Later on...
It is likely that more will be added to this tiny library as I see a need.
