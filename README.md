# aka-functional-lib
A library with some functional helpers not found in Typescript.

`npm install aka-functional-lib`

## Optional
Includes an Optional (Some or None) type. Provides a functional Match
pattern to get the value of an Optional, avoiding exceptions.

## Immutable
Includes a recursively Immutable type for Typescript as well as runtime
immutability by means of recursively freezing an Object. Make sure to mark
objects/data declared with the Immutable type as 'const'.

## Later on...
It is likely that more will be added to this tiny library as I see a need.
